[ROADMAP]

    * Support multiple servers and multiple versions.

    * Translation site / tool / ask for help.
    * Interface available in English and one more language.
    * Implement i18n.
    * Bring back locale support!

    * Support more authentication scenarios for embedded views / IFRAME,
      via CubesViewer server app (note upcoming Cubes auth framework).
    * App support for IFRAME embedding.
    * GUI support for browser back button, correct URL usage, links to GUI.

    * Support dimension attributes, and fact details in fact view etc..
    * Support better exploration of facts
    * Drop notes system 2: use metadata for info and add a comments system

    * Filter from chart filter / synchronize filter and chart filter (?).
    * GUI options (and all other plugin options) now as cubesviewer options
      (with plugin namespace?).
    * Hide interface mode (also, make these programmable options for the views)
    * Fix too many series in legend issue (limit? alternate legend?).
    * Avoid leaving the page inadvertedely (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    * Jump to added view when creating a view (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    * Short list cubes.js status for the list (fixes I had to do, not easy to add caching or get jQuery promise,
      not easy to get the path to be reused, missing facts I had to add, support for export/format,
      support for several servers desirable, inconsistent use of Cell/Browser interface or missing
      methods to transform drilldown_string<->drilldown object, same for cuts, documentation!!!!)

    * Separate in directives appropriately, restore "puggability", move cube "globals" to directive scopes.

    * Add anonymous-save service to backend and client (dedup).
    * Print feature (open tables and charts with appropriate height/width, hide most interface buttons).

    * X/Y/size bubble charts.
    * 3rd dimension scrollbar and play mode (for charts and series)
    * Time filter dynamic (zoomable, etc) when is horizontal dimension in appropriate chart mode (nvd3 does this ootb)
    * Make charts more interactive (allow cut from chart, etc).

    * Series annotation system: markers for annotations in time or other dimension.

    * Restore pluggability, publish API for views and GUI. Needed before adding stuff that
      needs to be optional in viewer, like loading bars to Studio, and to restore optional
      components (server-side stuff, etc). Provide good API. Use object for views,
      dimension, drilldown, etc...

[2.4]

    * Data alerts (server-backed, depending on criteria, with triggers (use cubetl)).
    * http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269 (Bubble chart: categories/sizes)
    * https://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/treemap.html (zoomable treemap)

[2.3]

    * Fulltext search (facts, dimension values, extra data) ?

[2.2]

    * Maintenance and missing stuff? Google Analytics, ~notes~->comments..., info metadata (html/url), etc...
    * Scroll to recently open view on GUI (also provide function to do it from code for standalone views).
    * Fact Viewer and fact templates (html/url/angular template?), i.e. including links to documents or etc...
    * Data formatters (color, decimals, abbreviations, units, etc...). Allow client side changes?
    * Implement limits to items shown in charts or dimension filters...?
    * Show filter icon from "horizontal dimension". Also show its detail level (and perhaps not the hierarchy).
    * Tooltip columns: column=val remove columnTooltipAttr, enable tooltips?
    * Abandon page warning?
    * Datepicker to show only to correct level (year, month, day)
    * Try reoder columns + pin columns again
    * Add fullscreen mode for a view (in this case, stretch grid and chart as appropriate?)

[2.1]

    * Map charts.
    * Issue #55 (chart shows measure name, not measure label).
    * Fix submenu timer hack: is causing issues already. Watch contents and perhaps debounce menu activation?
    * Add "accumulated", "difference" and other calculations to series and charts.
    * Issue #39, "strings with hyphen cause dimension filter to work inexpectedly".
    * Range filter.
    * Restore cached content notice (is missing, commented out).

[2.0]

    * Commit refactor branch, fork repository, commit refactor branch to cubesviewer-js
      and bring server changes to cubesviewer project. Rename repositories accordingly.
    * Test / QA.
    * Uncomment studio.html code that asks for the server url to connect to.
    * Test CORS issue from server (localhost:8000 -> localhost:5000), test JSONP.
    * Create site, update readme, and site screenshots.
    * Update screenshots.
    * Reviewed and improved doc
    * Allow direct link to URL (cubesviewer GUI reading configuration/anonymous-id from URL)


    * Cleanup code.
    * Site without styling, copy from Studio/GUI, use current background but make it fluid (sample views
      extending outside centered content). Show a couple of charts view, a table, and a enabled-controls view.
      SAME views to be automatically opened in the explorer sample.
    * Hide all unavailable options and not implemented options.
    * Radar chart doesn't resize

    * Only draw results for the requested view, otherwise discard result (is causing issues and confusion).
    * Default cube settings is incorrect: it should only be applied if the view is not otherwise configured (ie loaded or json)
    * Finish calculations: show infos, mark which ones are enabled, order, add series colorize (positive/negative), move "invert 2nd serie" as a calculation?

    ! Review flow/events: if cube or menu loading is happening before initialization if views are created eagerly (views.html), etc.

    * Cleaning nvtooltips seems is causing problems: tooltips not shown for previously drawn figures: clean only own figures.
    * Analytics plugin, and fix it to ignore first N seconds of events as for bounce rate calculation.
    * Server side.
    * Update undo/redo after column resize or other non-undo changes (do not change undo step, but keep it up to date)
    * Columns config "hooks" (hide / size)
