[HEAD]

    * Support multiple servers and multiple versions.
    * Improve dimension search (current approach is very slow). Text search?

    * Rework comments / ACLs / ownership / revisions if not done yet.
      (new module / website: annotate) (?)
    * Charts with time/sortable with series zoom?

    * Translation site / tool / ask for help.
    * Interface available in English and one more language (Spanish?).
    * Implement i18n.

    * Implement build system, concat simple file, minifying, etc.

    * Support more authentication scenarios for embedded views / IFRAME,
      via CubesViewer server app (note upcoming Cubes auth framework).
    * App support for IFRAME embedding.
    * GUI support for browser back button, correct URL usage, links to GUI.

    * Support dimension attributes, and fact details in fact view etc..
    * Support better exploration of facts
    * Drop notes system 2: use metadata for info and add a comments system
    * Analytics plugin to ignore first N seconds of events as for bounce rate calculation.

    * Ability to filter from chart filter / synchronize filter and chart filter (?).
    * Data formatters (color, decimals, abbreviations, units, etc...). Allow client side changes?
    * Allow to show blank for zeros (can be changed client side for the view)
    * Implement limits to items shown in charts or dimension filters...?
    * GUI options (and all other plugin options) now as cubesviewer options
      (with plugin namespace?).
    * Bring back locale support!
    * Horizontal dimension and measure dropdown from infobox (?) (see gui interface reworked)
    * Hide interface mode (also, make these programmable options for the views)
    * Fix too many series in legend issue (limit? alternate legend?).
    * Avoid leaving the page inadvertedely (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    * Jump to added view when creating a view (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    * Dialogs (serialize, others...) are no longer javascript alerts.
    * GUI Interface, don't use menus (use divs, resizable when necessary). Also put messages here.
    * Make it clear when the results limit has been hit (for dimension values and aggregations).
    * Support negated cuts (add quick "invert" button in the cut-box?).
    * Show filter icon from "horizontal dimension". Also show its detail level (and perhaps not the hierarchy).
    * Scroll to recently open view on GUI (also provide function to do it from code for standalone views).
    * Short list cubes.js status for the list (fixes I had to do, not easy to add caching or get jQuery promise,
      not easy to get the path to be reused, missing facts I had to add, support for export/format,
      support for several servers desirable, inconsistent use of Cell/Browser interface or missing
      methods to transform drilldown_string<->drilldown object, same for cuts, documentation!!!!)
    * Dimensions were somehow promoted to be kind of a top-level UI objects to be selectable/draggable

    * Add anonymous-save service to backend and client (dedup).
    * Map charts.

[2.0.1]

    * Reviewed and improved doc
    * Move doc to site (but import from repository markdown, to keep
      doc sources along with the  project).
    * Link from viewer to online doc.
    * Create site, update readme, and site screenshots.

    * Cleanup code, review headers (2016).
    * Use strict.
    * Review if cube or menu loading is happening before initialization if views are created eagerly (views.html).
    * Review readonly menus and pills, and invalid combinations and info messages.
    * Add loading indicators / block-ui (check angular plugins) as necessary.
    * Allow direct link to URL (cubesviewer GUI reading configuration/anonymous-id from URL)
    * Review alerts in code and use alert service.
    * Separate chart plugin in files.
