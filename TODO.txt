Consider contributing to CubesViewer. This is a possible roadmap.

[ROADMAP]

    * Support multiple servers and multiple versions.

    * Translation site / tool / ask for help.
    * Interface available in English and one more language.
    * Implement i18n.
    * Bring back locale support!

    * Support more authentication scenarios for embedded views / IFRAME,
      via CubesViewer server app (note upcoming Cubes auth framework).
    * App support for IFRAME embedding.
    * GUI support for browser back button, correct URL usage, links to GUI.

    * Support dimension attributes, and fact details in fact view etc..
    * Support better exploration of facts

    * Filter from chart filter / synchronize filter and chart filter (?).
    * GUI options (and all other plugin options) now as cubesviewer options
      (with plugin namespace?).
    * Hide interface mode (also, make these programmable options for the views)
    * Fix too many series in legend issue (limit? alternate legend?).
    * Avoid leaving the page inadvertedely (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    * Jump to added view when creating a view (also make back/forward/url_links work?)

    * Separate in directives appropriately, restore "puggability", move cube "globals" to directive scopes.

    * Add anonymous-save service to backend and client (dedup).
    * Print feature (open tables and charts with appropriate height/width, hide most interface buttons).

    * X/Y/size bubble charts.
    * 3rd dimension scrollbar and play mode (for charts and series)
    * Time filter dynamic (zoomable, etc) when is horizontal dimension in appropriate chart mode (nvd3 does this ootb)
    * Make charts more interactive (allow cut from chart, etc).

    * Series annotation system: markers for annotations in time or other dimension.
    * Default cube settings is incorrect? it should only be applied if the view is not otherwise configured (ie loaded or json)

    * Abstract backend?? Create CV objects for dimensions, levels, etc... Plug cubes as one more adaptor???
    * Divide in reusable angular directives (ie. start with fact viewer). JS doc. Make views
      proper objects.
    * Move to a more object oriented API, directives for widgets for model and cubeview.
      Keep drilldown and cuts as objects in API, serialize only as
      needed (and so introduce the ability optionally include column widths, etc).
    * Abstract data/grid in cubeview?
    * Use controllerAs.
    * Better loading bar (account for pending requests, etc).

[2.4]

    * Data alerts (server-backed, depending on criteria, with triggers (use cubetl)).
    * http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269 (Bubble chart: categories/sizes)
    * https://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/treemap.html (zoomable treemap)

[2.3]

    * Fulltext search (facts, dimension values, extra data) ?

[2.2]

    * Maintenance and missing stuff? Google Analytics, ~notes~->comments..., info metadata (html/url), etc...
    * Scroll to recently open view on GUI (also provide function to do it from code for standalone views).
    * Fact Viewer and fact templates (html/url/angular template?), i.e. including links to documents or etc...
    * Data formatters (color, decimals, abbreviations, units, etc...). Allow client side changes?
    * Implement limits to items shown in charts or dimension filters...?
    * Show filter icon from "horizontal dimension". Also show its detail level (and perhaps not the hierarchy).
    * Tooltip columns: column=val remove columnTooltipAttr, enable tooltips?
    * Abandon page warning?
    * Datepicker to show only to correct level (year, month, day)
    * Try reoder columns + pin columns again
    * Add fullscreen mode for a view (in this case, stretch grid and chart as appropriate?)
    * Drop notes system 2: use metadata for info and add a comments system
    * Allow direct link to URL (cubesviewer GUI reading configuration/anonymous-id from URL)

[2.1]

    * Export image (https://github.com/gabelerner/canvg works with nvd3).
    * Export SVG (svg crowbar).
    * Restore cached content notice (is missing, commented out).
    * Issue #55 (chart shows measure name, not measure label).
    * Fix submenu timer hack: is causing issues already. Watch contents and perhaps debounce menu activation?
    * Add "accumulated", "difference" and other operations to series and charts.
    * Add "grouping", allowing to group drilled down items (custom groups) using an aggregation of choice...
      Ability to save groups.
    * Add "reduce to N items" operation on series (allows to represent charts adding "Others" for the rest),
      reducing using some criteria -> uses grouping.
    * Automatically hide legend if too many results.
    * Finish calculations: show infos, mark which ones are enabled, order, add series colorize (positive/negative), move "invert 2nd serie" as a calculation?
    * Range filter.
    * Test and close issue #39, "strings with hyphen cause dimension filter to work inexpectedly" as shall be fixed.
    * Map charts.

[2.0]

    * Publish / announce.
    * Test / QA.
    * Uncomment studio.html code that asks for the server url to connect to.
    * Create site, update readme.
    * Update screenshots.
    * Add product subcategory to demo data.

    * Cleanup code.
    * Test CORS issue from server (localhost:8000 -> localhost:5000), test JSONP.
    * Site (page). Show a couple of charts view, a table, and an enabled-controls view.
      SAME views to be automatically opened in the explorer sample.

    * Reviewed and improved doc.
    * Dimension filter hierarchy level issue + drill more, drill less minibuttons + horizontal more/less
    * Submenu loading issue
    * Commit to master (both projects).
    * Pie chart/radar: do not draw if wrong column number message is being shown
    * Update docs (repo first). Add angular integration doc and example page.
